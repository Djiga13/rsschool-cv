##About me
---
We all see ourselves as ideal, so write about communication skills, responsibility, etc. I will not, since this is a complete banal (if anything, then all this is in me). I want to note in myself a few things that I consider the most valuable: the desire to develop and not stand still, love for my Motherland and the desire to make it even better, I treat criticism adequately, because it allows you to grow and develop, the main thing is to stop talking and start acting.
